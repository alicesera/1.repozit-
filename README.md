# SQL Project – Wage Analysis
# Project Description
  The project aimed to establish a robust database for comparing food availability based on average incomes in the Czech Republic over a specific period and addressing five research questions. 
  Another objective was to create a table with GDP, GINI coefficient, and population data for other European countries during the same period as the primary Czech Republic overview.

# Questions
## Question 1
  Have wages increased in all sectors over time, or have there been any declines?
## Question 2
  How much milk and bread can be purchased in the initial and final comparable periods using the available price and wage data?
## Question 3
  Which food category is experiencing the slowest increase in prices (lowest year-on-year percentage increase)?
## Question 4
  Is there a year with a food price increase significantly exceeding wage growth (greater than 10%)?
## Question 5
  Does GDP influence changes in wages and food prices? 
  If GDP increases significantly in one year, will this result in a corresponding increase in food prices or wages in the same or following year?
